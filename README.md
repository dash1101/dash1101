## Projects
### RPCortex
#### An operating system that is written for the RP2040 and the RP2350 in MicroPython which gives similar functionality as some DOS and other CLI-based operating systems.
#### Includes some advanced functions, and networking capabilities, along with a modular hardware configuration that can be programmed to do essentially anything.
Currently working on v0.7-alpha. Adds a whole bunch of functionality and performance increases.
