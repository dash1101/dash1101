# 👋 Hi there!
- ✌️ I’m a high school student at MHS with a passion for technology. My interests are **cybersecurity**, **software development**, and **hardware tinkering**, and I love exploring the intersection of these fields.
## Projects
- 🚀 One of my proudest projects is **RPCortex**, a CLI OS that I developed to run on the **RP2040** and **RP2350** processors.

**🏎️ A fun-fact** about me is that I really like watching races (Formula, Indycar, Nascar, etc.), and racing around in RaceRoom!
